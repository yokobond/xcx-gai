## Costume Editor with Generated Files

Here's an example project that demonstrates how to use AI-generated files to create and edit costume images.
In this project, AI generates new costume images based on user instructions, and these generated images are automatically applied to sprites as new costumes.

### How it works

1. The user provides instructions for how they want to modify or create costume images
2. AI generates new images based on these instructions
3. The project uses the `generated file data at [INDEX]` block to retrieve the generated image files
4. The generated images are automatically added as new costumes to the sprite

### How to Use

1. Click the green flag to enter your API key
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to describe how you want to modify or create the costume
3. The AI generates a new costume image and applies it to the sprite

### Key Blocks Used

- `generated file data at [INDEX]` - Retrieves the data URL of generated image files
- `max generated file count` - Gets the total number of files generated by AI
- Costume management blocks to add new costumes to sprites

### Note

This example requires an AI provider that supports image generation (such as certain models that can create images based on text descriptions). Make sure to set up your API key for a compatible AI service before running the project.
